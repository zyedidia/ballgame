# Mini Mesoamerican Ballgame

This is a "Game Jam"-esque game which adapts the Mesoamerican ballgame into a
virtual format.

# Installation

Prebuilt binaries are available on the releases page for MacOS, Linux, and
Windows.

To build from source:

```
$ go run assets_generate.go
$ go build
```

# Gameplay

You lose if the ball hits the ground, and you get one point for getting the
ball through the ring.  The game is quite difficult! On hard mode my high score
is 13, and on impossible my high score is 3.
